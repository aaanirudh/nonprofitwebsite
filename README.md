# consams-web-app
What is the repo/project about?
    This project is meant to create a web-app for a VUMC professor working with CONSAMS, an African consortium of medical schools. We aim to create a website with basic classroom features, the ability to paywall content, process payments for the organization, and create a digital presence that CONSAMS can easily update. We are using a MERN stack, since much of our data will be object based, and we all have some familarity with typescript. We plan to integrate industry standard security practices, and to minimize the amount of data we collect on each user. Ultimately we aim to supercharge CONSMAS with a digital presence that allows them to quickly and securely spread their knowledge across Africa.
